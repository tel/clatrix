;;; Clatrix is a fast matrix library for Clojure written atop [JBlas](http://jblas.org/)'
;;; ATLAS/LAPACK bindings. It's not intended to be the alpha and omega
;;; of linear algebra hosted on Clojure, but it should provide most of
;;; the basics for enabling more scientific/mathematical computation.

;;; # The clatrix matrix

;;; Matrix is implemented as a clojure Sequence data structure over JBlas'
;;; `DoubleMatrix` class. Many of the basic Clojure methods, such as
;;; `first`, `rest`, `cons`, and even some higher level functions, such as
;;; `map` and `reduce`, works with `Matrix`.
;;;
;;; The `Matrix` type is useful to operate on matrices in Clojure
;;; and to hide the underlying Java methods. It is not hard to access these
;;; Java methods (they're available through the `me` function), but their use is dissuaded.
